SPECIFICATIONS:
SFML 2.5.1
2018 Q4

This class has been created with the idea of increasing performance in a large
scale game application that references a large amount of textures. With the
implementation of this class, it will be easier to store references to all
textures used, such that no texture is loaded twice, wasting precious memory.
As of now, this class has been redisgned to hold sound files as well, with the
same intention of increasing performance as before

The basic structure of the class will be a map that holds the loaded references
and a method that will allow for the user to both access and create entries
fluidly.

  to all of the sprites necessary

  The key for the map will be the path to the file, such that we can not only
  access the texture through this, but differentiate between similarly named
  files in different locations

  It is defined as static such that no instance of the class needs to be created
